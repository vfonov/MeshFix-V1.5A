To compile in Cygwin x64 (Windows 10 x64)

Install the following in cygwin:
gcc
gcc-fortran
liblapack0 (or other blas)
g++
make
cmake

Then compile Superlu 5.2.1 (to be statically linked to meshfix):
Use superLU_CMakeLists_cygwin.txt as CMakeLists.txt for superLU it may also compile without modifications - but in that case it will use the included CBLAS (expected to be slower).
in superlu run:
cmake .
make
make install

MeshFix:
Rename CMakeLists_cygwin.txt -> CMakeLists.txt
run:
cmake .
make
